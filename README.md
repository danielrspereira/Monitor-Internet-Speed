# MonitorDSLSpeed

This repository contains a Python application to monitor the download and upload speed every 3 minutes

1) Objective

The objective of this application is to help internet users to check if the internet provider is delivering the contracted connection speed.

2) Introduction

Internet providers use the maximum connection speed that can be achieved for marketing their products. This strategy is deceiving, once most of the time the delivered quality is way below it. The regulations vary from country to country. In Brazil internet providers are obligated to deliver 80% of the contracted maximum connection speed as a month average and only 40% for the instantaneous speed.
